Restaurants apps using PWA

Great to share my latest project on one of my journey from Independent Study program from DICODING!

I'm using Restaurants API from dicoding https://restaurant-api.dicoding.dev/#/

Here are the features within this application:

  At this era mobile user are everywhere at anytime. To enhance user experience for mobile user I use Mobile Design First for better responsive web apps.
  Ofcourse Tablet and Laptop are also have good a good responsive view!

  Adding several features like notification, offline accessibility, and downloadable apps!
